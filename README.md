# deep_learning
Repository for playing around with modern methods in Deep Learning

## GAN - Generative Adversarial Network
Contains one notebook, keras_GAN, used for learning the basics of GANs using google colab

## Handwriting
Contains one handwriting.ipynb notebook using CNNs to classify letters from the extended mnist (emnist) set

I looked at adding a class for spaces between letters to classify strings of letters in words

Really didn't get very far with this - hope to come back to it one day
